This project is created for me to learn the Javascript programming language.
The sequencer is made with Tone.js Web Audio framework API and the knobs are webaudio-controls.
Don't rely on the code to be optimized.
It's simply a project made to learn as much of the basics of Javascript, Node.js & MongoDB with Mongoose.
The database is mainly for storing the presets list and interaction with votes.

All audio samples (WAV) files are made by myself and friends.
