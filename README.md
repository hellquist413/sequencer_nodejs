~ Music sequencer project ~

What is this?
This is made for me to learn Javascript language. The project is made with Tone.js Web Audio framework API and for the knobs I've used webaudio-controls. Don't rely on the code to be safe or optimized. It's simply project made to learn all the basics of javascript.

The project runs on Node.js and uses a MongoDB database to setup the presets list.

All audio samples (WAV) files are made by myself and producer friends.
